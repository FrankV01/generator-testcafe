# generator-testcafe
[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator for testcafe. At present, this only generates a self-contained test suite. I'm looking to enhance it though; contributions are welcomed. 

## Usage

You'll need to install Yeoman and this package. 

`
npm install -g yeoman
npm install -g generator-testcafe
`

Then establish a folder for your new testcafe project and `cd` into it and execute: 

`yo testcafe` 

The new project should be generated. After generation run `npm test` to ensure all is working.
